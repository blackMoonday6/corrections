this repo contains the code we use as a correction Code. 

- Camera debugging code
- Correction of the cherry Counter (in the panier)

# Useful links

the student should first open the camera through a python script, as described in the code of the camera debugger
then he starts from it building the final code described in the correction of the cherry Counter following the next steps:

- [HSV Color Space] - the different color spaces that exists gives us the ability to distinguish color easily
- [Color Detection] - the color detection example from opencv documentation : it detects the blue color
- [Detect other colors] - the student should change thresholds to get to right color (red) we need in our code
- [Contours] - opencv example to detect contours, it's the notion we gonna need to count nerf balls
- [Contour areas] - it's the feature we gonna use to know if it's a ball or not (eliminate small contours)
